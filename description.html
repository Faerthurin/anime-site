          <p>
            Haruyuki "Haru" Arita is a short, overweight boy who is frequently
            ridiculed by delinquents at the Umesato Junior High School. Using
            his Neuro Linker to escape the torment of real life, he logs onto
            the school's Local Network cyberspace where he always plays virtual
            squash alone, and his innate video game skills bring him to the
            attention of Kuroyukihime (literally meaning "Black Snow Princess"),
            the school's popular, highly intellectual and attractive female
            Student Council Vice-President. After helping him against the
            delinquents, Kuroyukihime introduces Haruyuki to Brain Burst, a
            secret program that is able to accelerate the human cognitive
            process to the point at which time appears to stop. Haruyuki soon
            learns that Brain Burst is more than just a program, but an
            Augmented Reality Massively Multiplayer Online (ARMMO) Fighting Game
            where people fight each other in fierce duels in order to obtain
            Burst Points which can be spent for acceleration abilities in the
            real world. Kuroyukihime then enlists Haruyuki's help in reaching
            Level 10 within Brain Burst by defeating the "Six Kings of Pure
            Colour" and ultimately meet the creator of Brain Burst to learn its
            true purpose. With every challenge they face in the Accelerated
            World, Haru and Kuroyukihime, under their aliases "Silver Crow" and
            "Black Lotus", gather trusted allies, confront treacherous enemies
            and their bond grows stronger while working to attain their ultimate
            objective: to reach the highest in-game level and meet the game's
            creator, who will reveal why the game was created and the true
            purpose of it.
