            one day, when he finds that all his high scores have been topped by
            Kuroyukihime, the popular vice president of the student council. She
            then invites him to the student lounge and introduces him to "Brain
            Burst," a program which allows the users to accelerate their brain
            waves to the point where time seems to stop. Brain Burst also
            functions as an augmented reality fighting game, and in order to get
            more points to accelerate, users must win duels against other
            players. However, if a user loses all their points, they will also
            lose access to Brain Burst forever. Kuroyukihime explains that she
            chose to show Haruyuki the program because she needs his help. She
            wants to meet the creator of Brain Burst and uncover the reason of
            why it was created, but that's easier said than done; to do so, she
            must defeat the "Six Kings of Pure Color," powerful faction leaders
            within the game, and reach level 10, the highest level attainable.
            After the girl helps Haruyuki overcome the bullies that torment him,
            he vows to help her realize her goal, and so begins the duo's fight
            to reach the top.

            planet Earth has been left in ruins, with much of its ecosystem
            completely destroyed. Because it was no longer possible to live a

            other planets where life will, hopefully, be more comfortable. The
            Deep Galactic Trade Organization, a totalitarian government that
            affects many of the newly inhabited planets, has somehow come to the
            conclusion that music is a source of evil, and that it must be
            banned and destroyed for good. The talent group AKB0048 is soon
            formed, based on the original AKB48 members that once lived on
            Earth. Even though their music is now considered universally

            that divides up the student body. The highest scorers are placed
            into A class, all the way down until F class, for the lowest of the
            low. Unfortunately for Akihisa Yoshii, his supposedly "great"
            intellect wasn't quite enough for such a test, and he's now stuck at
            the bottom of F class. Naturally, F class has the worst facilities:
            not only rotten tatami mats and broken tables, but also outdated
            equipment and worn out furniture. On the bright side, his friend

            summon fantasy characters—whose power levels are equal to their

            Asta and Yuno were abandoned at the same church on the same day.
            Raised together as children, they came to know of the "Wizard
            King"—a title given to the strongest mage in the kingdom—and
            promised that they would compete against each other for the position
            of the next Wizard King. However, as they grew up, the stark
            difference between them became evident. While Yuno is able to wield
            magic with amazing power and control, Asta cannot use magic at all
            and desperately tries to awaken his powers by training physically.
            When they reach the age of 15, Yuno is bestowed a spectacular
            Grimoire with a four-leaf clover, while Asta receives nothing.
            However, soon after, Yuno is attacked by a person named Lebuty,
            whose main purpose is to obtain Yuno's Grimoire. Asta tries to fight
            Lebuty, but he is outmatched. Though without hope and on the brink
            of defeat, he finds the strength to continue when he hears Yuno's
            voice. Unleashing his inner emotions in a rage, Asta receives a
            five-leaf clover Grimoire, a "Black Clover" giving him enough power
            to defeat Lebuty. A few days later, the two friends head out into
            the world, both seeking the same goal—to become the Wizard King!

            resulting eruption. He discovers a mysterious girl at its source,
            who is revealed to be a "Spirit," an otherworldly entity whose
            appearance triggers a spatial quake. Soon after, he becomes
            embroiled in a skirmish between the girl and the Anti-Spirit Team, a
            ruthless strike force with the goal of annihilating Spirits.
            However, there is a third party that believes in saving the spirits:
            "Ratatoskr," which surprisingly is commanded by Shidou's little
            sister! Kotori forcibly recruits Shidou after the clash, presenting
            to him an alternative method of dealing with the danger posed by the
            Spirits—make them fall in love with him. Now, the fate of the world
            rests on his dating prowess, as he seeks out Spirits in order to
            charm them.

          <h2>Death Note</h2>
          <p>
            Brutal murders, petty thefts, and senseless violence pollute the
            human world. In contrast, the realm of death gods is a humdrum,
            unchanging gambling den. The ingenious 17-year-old Japanese student
            Light Yagami and sadistic god of death Ryuk share one belief: their
            worlds are rotten. For his own amusement, Ryuk drops his "Death
            Note" into the human world. Light stumbles upon it, deeming the
            first of its rules ridiculous: the human whose name is written in
            this note shall die. However, the temptation is too great, and Light
            experiments by writing a felon's name, which disturbingly enacts his
            first murder. Aware of the terrifying godlike power that has fallen
            into his hands, Light—under the alias "Kira"—follows his wicked
            sense of justice with the ultimate goal of cleansing the world of
            all evil-doers. The meticulous mastermind detective L is already on
            his trail, but as Light's brilliance rivals L's, the grand chase for
            Kira turns into an intense battle of wits that can only end when one
            of them is dead.

            Ever since the death of his father, the burden of supporting the
            family has fallen upon Tanjirou Kamado's shoulders. Though living
            impoverished on a remote mountain, the Kamado family are able to
            enjoy a relatively peaceful and happy life. One day, Tanjirou
            decides to go down to the local village to make a little money
            selling charcoal. On his way back, night falls, forcing Tanjirou to
            take shelter in the house of a strange man, who warns him of the
            existence of flesh-eating demons that lurk in the woods at night.
            When he finally arrives back home the next day, he is met with a
            horrifying sight—his whole family has been slaughtered. Worse still,
            the sole survivor is his sister Nezuko, who has been turned into a
            bloodthirsty demon. Consumed by rage and hatred, Tanjirou swears to
            avenge his family and stay by his only remaining sibling. Alongside
            the mysterious group calling themselves the Demon Slayer Corps,
            Tanjirou will do whatever it takes to slay the demons and protect
            the remnants of his beloved sister's humanity.

          <p>
            Even after death, life is full of paperwork and criminals. Tsuzuki
            Asato is a 26 year old, happy-go-lucky, and dorky shinigami (god of
            death) whose job is to makes sure that those who are dead remain
            dead and stay in their proper realms. Even though he's had this job
            for over 70 years, he is in the worst division with horrible pay. He
            also has a knack for not keeping partners (since shinigami work in
            pairs), but now he seems to have one that will stick around;
            stubborn, smart-mouthed, serious and defensive 16 year old, Kurosaki
            Hisoka. With each case they investigate, they come closer to the
            conspiracies of the serial killer Dr. Muraki Kazutaka. Tsuzuki's
            relationship with Hisoka is growing stronger and closer...but there
            is a dark past to how Tsuzuki died that will not give him peace.
